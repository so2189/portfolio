          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project is a website designed to support individuals following plant-based diets by helping them discover
            nutritionally fulfilling recipes tailored to their personal health needs. Using the Spoonacular API, the platform retrieves
            a wide variety of recipes and provides insight into the nutritional impact of each meal, empowering users to make informed
            food choices. The tool is especially helpful for those with dietary restrictions or specific health goals, offering an inclusive
            and customizable experience.
