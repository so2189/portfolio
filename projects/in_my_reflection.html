            An interactive art installation created to promote
            self-reflection through immersive audiovisual interaction. The project transforms a live camera feed into 
            a pixelated, water-like reflection of the user and integrates voice-based responses into the experience using 
            <b>p5.js</b> and <b>ml5.js</b> libraries. This audio-based reflective experience journals your vocal responses and was created for
            a course called Interactive Computing with one partner.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>In My Reflection Experience</b> is an interactive artwork that uses water as a metaphor for introspection. 
          Viewers are invited to verbally respond to a series of reflective questions while seeing their likeness mirrored 
          in a dynamic, pixelated water surface. Their spoken words appear as rippling text within the reflection, 
          symbolizing how thoughts and emotions shape one’s self-image.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by the reflective qualities of water, our goal was to create an experience that visually represents 
          personal reflection. We wanted users to see themselves—literally and figuratively—while responding to questions 
          that promote mindfulness and self-awareness. The project combines computer vision, speech recognition, and 
          generative art to create an experience that evolves with each participant.
        </p>

        <h2>Methods & Tools</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✦ Pixelated video reflection using <code>createCapture()</code> and <b>pointillism</b></li>
          <li>✦ Dynamic text effects via <code>textToPoints()</code> and <code>sin()</code> oscillation</li>
          <li>✦ <b>ml5.js</b> <code>PoseNet</code> and <code>Body Segmentation</code> for real-time body tracking</li>
          <li>✦ <b>p5.speech</b> library for audio recognition and speech-to-text</li>
          <li>✦ Ripple effects and wave animation using Perlin noise and sine functions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Process & Updates</h2>

        <p>
          Early stages involved setting up the camera input and testing pixelation effects. We explored methods to visualize 
          users’ reflections using pointillism and experimented with wave animations inspired by oscillating dot patterns. 
          We also began integrating <b>ml5 PoseNet</b> for facial tracking and considered how to segment the user’s head and 
          shoulders from the background.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final experience features four reflective questions navigated via arrow buttons. Users activate the microphone 
          to respond verbally, and their speech is transcribed and visualized as wave-like text around their reflection. 
          <b>Body segmentation</b> masks non-body pixels, simulating a watery mirror. Text is positioned dynamically around 
          the user’s face using <b>PoseNet</b> ear tracking. Additional enhancements include a ripple animation object that 
          reacts to mouse presses and a start/end screen to introduce and conclude the experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Performance optimizations involved using alpha-mapped masks instead of multiple buffer layers to reduce lag. 
          Future improvements include more precise facial mapping, transparent background segmentation, and additional question sets 
          themed around personal, collective, and environmental reflection.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          I developed the button and microphone interface for smooth question navigation, implemented oscillating text effects using 
          <code>sin()</code>, and integrated <b>ml5 Body Pose</b> for ear-based tracking of user reflections. I optimized body 
          segmentation by refining alpha masks and designed the HTML/CSS interface for the project. Additionally, I handled audio 
          playback management and incorporated sound effects during save interactions.
        </p>
